/**
 * The server's one connection pool to TypeSafe, and an honest record of whether
 * each call had to open a new connection or reused a warm one.
 *
 * Production lesson: open the connection when the server boots, before the first
 * user request needs it, so nobody pays the TCP and TLS handshakes on the critical
 * path. Then set the keep-alive to outlast the usual gap between requests, because
 * Node drops an idle connection after 4 seconds and TypeSafe sends no keep-alive
 * hint to extend it.
 *
 * Sources: undici's `Agent` options (`keepAliveTimeout`, types/client.d.ts), the
 * `dispatcher` fetch option (types/fetch.d.ts), and the `undici:client:connected`
 * diagnostics channel (lib/core/diagnostics.js, published in
 * lib/dispatcher/client.js once a socket is connected).
