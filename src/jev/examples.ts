/**
 * Prepopulated, runnable examples for each panel.
 *
 * All three share one subject, a small fictional film catalogue, so the reader
 * can compare what each primitive is good for:
 * - Noul answers several independent yes/no questions about one review.
 * - Choice sorts every film into a genre in a single request (one question per film).
 * - Score places every film on the same ordered scale so the answers can be ranked.
 *
 * Question ids are for code only; the model never sees them, so each
 * `instructions` carries the complete question. Backticked paths such as
 * `films[2]` point the model at one part of a structured state.
